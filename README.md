# TARS
TARS ( name inspired from the AI/robot companion of Interstellar ), is a standard voice assistant built in Python.

  Several packages are needed to run this program and they can be found in the imports, however Selenium is not yet needed. 
  You will also need to use your own Wolfram Alpha API key, as I took mine out for privacy and security. 

  After some painstaking debugging, the integration with the Wolfram Alpha API is complete and it is now working as intended.

  After the mathematical portion of the assistant has been fixed and is up and running, the next area of focus would be the 
Google Translate API. Personally, while I did follow a tutorial for much of the engine building, I feel like integrating
the Google Translate API ( which is not a part of the tutorial ) will prove to be useful and more challenging.
