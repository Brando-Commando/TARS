# TARS
TARS ( name inspired from the AI/robot companion of Interstellar ), is a standard voice assistant built in Python.

  Several packages are needed to run this program and they can be found in the imports, however Selenium is not yet needed. 
  You will also need to use your own Wolfram Alpha API key, as I took mine out for privacy and security. 

  So far, I have gotten the engine to work and the introduction. However, my first concern and goal is to get the calculations 
with Wolfram Alpha up and running. I am unsure as to exactly what issue im dealing with. Most likely an issue dealing with 
syntax when connecting and providing input to the Wolfram Alpha API. As there are certain inputs that do yield a result, albiet
an innacurate and nonsensical one. A result is a step foward from an error. 

  After the mathematical portion of the assistant has been fixed and is up and running, the next area of focus would be the 
Google Translate API. Personally, while I did follow a tutorial for much of the engine building, I feel like integrating
the Google Translate API ( which is not a part of the tutorial ) will prove to be useful and more challenging.
